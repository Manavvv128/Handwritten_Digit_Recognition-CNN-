# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition-CNN-
This project demonstrates a complete handwritten digit recognition pipeline using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. It handles real-world images of handwritten digit sequences – including images written with mouse, touch input, or pen on paper – and successfully segments and classifies each digit.
